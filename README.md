# Fruits_Classification
This repository contains code for a deep learning-based image classification model that can classify various types of fruits and vegetables. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images of different fruits and vegetables, and it leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.

# Features:
-Image Classification: Given an input image of a fruit or vegetable, the model predicts its class label from a predefined set of categories.

-Preprocessing: The input images are preprocessed to normalize pixel values and resize them to a consistent size before feeding them into the model.

-Visualization: The repository includes code for visualizing the prediction probabilities for each class, allowing users to interpret the model's predictions.

-Streamlit App: The project includes a Streamlit web application that provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and obtaining predictions from the trained model in real-time.

# Dataset:
The model is trained on a dataset containing thousands of images of various fruits and vegetables, including apples, bananas, oranges, tomatoes, carrots, and more. The dataset is curated to ensure diversity in terms of fruit and vegetable types, sizes, and orientations.

# Usage:
To use the model, simply upload an image of a fruit or vegetable through the Streamlit app interface. The model will then process the image and display the predicted class label along with the confidence score.
